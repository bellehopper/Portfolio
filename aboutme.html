        <h1>Reflection: 7/7/17</h1>
        
        <p>Today I learned that HTML is super annoying and sucks.<br>Just kidding.<br>Although semantic errors and debugging are annoying,<br> when your code finally works, it feels great.<br> I liked being able to customize and make a website from scratch.<br> Well, HTML and CSS, not Scratch. <p>

        <h1> Core4 Portfolio 7/12/17 </h1>
            
            <h2> Variables </h2>
            <p>Variables represent values. They can change.<br>
            <img src="VariableSnip.JPG" width="400" height="50">
            <p>A variable is like a bowl. What it is, is always the same<br>but what it holds can vary</p>
            
            <h2> Loops </h2>
            <p>Loops involove actions and a true or false questions.<br>A computer will check the answer for a question<br>and do an action repeatedly until the questions is true</p>
            <img src="LoopSnip.JPG" align = "middle" width="400" height="220">
            <p>A loop is like the game "Simon Says" You continue to say what the speaker says<br>until the speaker doesn't say "Simon Says"</p>
            
            <h2>Conditionals</h2>
            <p>A computer will do certain actions based on<br>whether the question for an answer is true of false</p>
            <img src="ConditionalSnip.JPG" align = "middle" width="350" height="400">
            <p>A conditional is like a barista. They ask you if you want caramel in your<br>drink. Based on whether you said yes or no, they will or<br>will not give you caramel</p>
            
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>Functons are defined commands or set of actions.<br>They can take inputs and give you outputs.<br>You can call of them to use them</p>
            <img src="FunctionSnip.JPG" width="400" height="300" align = "middle">
            <p>A function is like the action of making a sauce for a dish.<br>There are a few steps involved, but the steps and the recipe are<br>already known by the chef. It can be a step in<br>the bigger recipe (or bigger, overall program). It will take ingredients (or inputs) and<br>give an output (the finished sauce)</p>
          
         <h1> Data Structure Reflection 7/14/17 </h1>
            
            <h2> Lists </h2>
            <p> Lists in python are sets of data. In python, a sinlge list can be made up of different data types. </p>
            <p> Lists are useful because they can hold different data, can be used to group data, and can be used when<br>you want to randomly select an option from a group or set.</p>
            
         <h2> Obamicon Filter Program in Python</h2>
            <h3> Today we made a program that applied an obamicon filter to an image.</h3>
            <h3> Here are some of my examples: <h3>

         <h1> Robotics Week! 7/17/14 - 7/20/17 </h1>
             <h2> Robot </h2>
                 <p> We got to work on breadboarding. We made circuits with blinking LEDs, push buttons, and piezos </p>
                 <p>It was interseting to see how a push button works and how you could program piezos<br>to play songs by finding the frequency of the note you want </p>
                 <p> We also got to combine all of that knowledge with what we learned about servos to make a<br>robot that could sing, dance, and light up. The group I was a part of used<br>arduino to have the robot sing and dance to "Eye of the Tiger" </p>
                
              <h2> Wearable Tech </h2>
                  <p> We got to spend a day using the Adafruit Circuit Playground. We were given starter codes so that we can<br>see how the different functions and features worked. The prompt<br>also gave us challenges and extensions so that we could practice using these different<br>functions and features. For example, I was able to code the adafruit<br>so that the LEDs would light up different colors depending<br>on the brightness the light sensor was exposed to </p>
          <h1>Gibson Dunn 7/21/17</h1>
          <p>We got to visit the law firm, Gibson Dunn. They have clients such as Apple and Uber and have been involved<br>in over 100 Supreme Court cases. We were visited a number of speakers. It was interesting to see how ethical hackers could be used to improve the security of the<br>Pentagon. I enjoyed learning about the importance of cybersecurity and how tech is important,<br>even to legal institution. The creation of a<br>school that focuses on computer sciences and gives students access to resources such as mentors<br>is really cool. I was able to learn the importance of using my privilege and skills<br>to help others how aren't as fortunate or who are being done an injustice</p>
                
                <h1> JavaScript 7/24/17 </h1>
                    <p> Today I learned the different commands for JavaScript.<br>I really liked JavaScript because I liked being able to make a more dynamic and interactive website.<br> I edited my website so that when the user hovers over a certain part of the website,<br> the background of the site would change</p>
                
                <h1> Django 7/26/17 </h1>
                    <p>Today we worked developing a site using. It was a rather meticulous process.<br>There were many steps and no room for mistakes or carelessness.<br>Although it was tedious and a little stressful, it gave me a new <br>appreciation for website development. I realize how much work, time, and effort<br>is put into the creation of sites (like instagram) that we use everyday<br>without thinking of the process of how they were created. This is a skill I think would be fulfilling to perfect, even if the journey may be hard. </p>
