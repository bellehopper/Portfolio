        <p>Hello World.</p>

        I'm learning how to code this summer.

        <h1>Reflection: 7/7/17</h1>
        
        <p>Today I learned that HTML is super annoying and sucks.<br>Just kidding.<br>Although semantic errors and debugging are annoying,<br> when your code finally works, it feels great.<br> I liked being able to customize and make a website from scratch.<br> Well, HTML and CSS, not Scratch. <p>

        <h1> Core4 Portfolio 7/12/17 </h1>
            
            <h2> Variables </h2>
            <p>Variables represent values. They can change.<br>
            <img src="VariableSnip.JPG" width="400" height="50">
            <p>A variable is like a bowl. What it is, is always the same<br>but what it holds can vary</p>
            
            <h2> Loops </h2>
            <p>Loops involove actions and a true or false questions.<br>A computer will check the answer for a question<br>and do an action repeatedly until the questions is true</p>
            <img align = center src="LoopSnip.JPG" width="400" height="220">
            <p>A loop is like the game "Simon Says" You continue to say what the speaker says<br>until the speaker doesn't say "Simon Says"</p>
            
            <h2>Conditionals</h2>
            <p>A computer will do certain actions based on<br>whether the question for an answer is true of false</p>
            <img align = "center" src="ConditionalSnip.JPG" width="350" height="400">
            <p>A conditional is like a barista. They ask you if you want caramel in your<br>drink. Based on whether you said yes or no, they will or<br>will not give you caramel</p>
            
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>Functons are defined commands or set of actions.<br>They can take inputs and give you outputs.<br>You can call of them to use them</p>
            <img src="FunctionSnip.JPG" width="400" height="300">
            <p>A function is like the action of making a sauce for a dish.<br>There are a few steps involved, but the steps and the recipe are<br>already known by the chef. It can be a step in<br>the bigger recipe (or bigger, overall program). It will take ingredients (or inputs) and<br>give an output (the finished sauce)</p>

            <h2> Lists </h2>
            <p> Lists in python are sets of data. In python, a sinlge list can be made up of different data types. </p>
            <p> Lists are useful because they can hold different data, can be used to group data, and can be used when<br>you want to randomly select an option from a group or set.</p>
            
         <h2> Obamicon Filter Program in Python</h2>
            <h3> Today we made a program that applied an obamicon filter to an image.</h3>
            <h3> Here are some of my examples: <h3>
